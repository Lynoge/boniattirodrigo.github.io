**Hello folks**, I love TED Talks, I always see videos there when I'm free time and today I share with you, my 5 most favorites TED Talks.

My first is **Massive-scale online collaboration** by Luis von Ahn, it shows how we can make the difference in the world with a little bit and simple ideas. [Check out](https://www.ted.com/talks/luis_von_ahn_massive_scale_online_collaboration).

Second. Elon Musk is an awesome man, he really makes fantastic things, in this show he speaks about your companies and how he do to innovate every time. **The mind behind Tesla, SpaceX and SolarCity**. [Link](https://www.ted.com/talks/elon_musk_the_mind_behind_tesla_spacex_solarcity).

Third: **A passionate, personal case for education**, by Michelle Obama, I love fantastic life history, in this Michelle says how was your childhood and how education transforms it. [Take a look](http://www.ted.com/talks/michelle_obama).

Fourth: **The agony of trying to unsubscribe**. I like this show because James Veitch is a funny boy and he speaks most deep truly about the emails marketing. [See](https://www.ted.com/talks/james_veitch_the_agony_of_trying_to_unsubscribe).

The last but not the least, **Do schools kill creativity?** It's most famous TED Talk of all the time, if you kill the creativity, you kill dreams, interests and love for education. [Worth to see](https://www.ted.com/talks/ken_robinson_says_schools_kill_creativity).
