Starting with Git Flow

Git flow is a great feature for use with git, with it you can to separate
your project what is in developement and production, beyond you create branch
for your own features. Ok, we go ahead with examples:

For you kick stater you need install git flow, it's very easy, check out in
documentation:

http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/#setup

When you think in branch, you need put in your mind that is necessary organization your
project through features, each new feature is a new branch, ok let's see how we do that.

First, initialize the git flow:
git flow init

Then, do your new branch (feature):
git flow feature start MYFEATURE

Now, you put all code about this feature here.

For finish it, only need:
git flow feature finish MYFEATURE

If you need share with you team, make:
git flow feature publish MYFEATURE

Ok. Now we know that each feature need a branch, when we finish a feature we can merge with we main branch for develop,
